  Title: Re-fracturing of Pieces
  Description: 'Similar to the glued edges example with one notable exception.


    "Num Generations" on the glass pane''s RuntimeFracturedGeometry has a value greater
    than one. As long as this value is not zero, the fracture component can be fractured.


    Since the "Fracture Template" also has a RuntimeFracturedGeometry, the generation
    value will be decremented by one and set on the fracture pieces. This effectively
    allows the glass to be re-fractured a fixed number of times.'
