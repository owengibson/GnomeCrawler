  Title: Pre-fractured Wall Chipping
  Description: 'This demonstrates how chunks can be taken out of fixed object, such
    as a wall using the ChipOnFracture script. The FractureSize is set to a non-zero
    value and the FractureOnCollision & ChipOnFracture scripts are added to the fracturing
    geometry.


    The wall has been pre-fractured in the editor. No fracturing
    is happening at runtime when chunks are chipped away.'
