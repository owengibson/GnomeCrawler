  Title: Pre-fractured Mesh
  Description: 'This column has a PreFracturedGeometry component attached. This allows
    the column to be fractured in the editor, before the game has even started.


    The major benefit to pre-fracturing is performance, especially on low-end devices.
    The time and memory used to create the pieces does not matter because the pieces
    are baked into the game. This allows you to fracture with a large number of pieces
    or use a very complex mesh and have the fracture happen instantly at runtime.


    The major downside is that the results are static. Fracturing simply activates
    pieces already in the scene.


    This column has 125 pieces that appear instantly.'
