  Description: 'This is a good script to add to every fracture template. It will
    ensure that the generated mesh is destroyed when the fracture piece is destroyed.
    Works with meshes that are generated in the editor or runtime.


    Failure
    to destroy the mesh on runtime fractured geometry can cause the generated mesh
    to leak.'
