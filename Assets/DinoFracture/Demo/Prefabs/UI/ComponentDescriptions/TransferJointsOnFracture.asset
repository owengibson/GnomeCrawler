  Description: 'The fracture pieces generated from fracturing an object with this
    script will attempt to join the joint that was on this object.


    An individual fractured piece will only attach if the collider on the piece is
    within a specified distance to the joint''s anchor.


    All joint properties are automatically copied to the resulting pieces. The "Fracture
    Template" does not need a joint component on it. One of the correct type will
    automatically be added.'
