  Name: GlueEdgeOnFracture
  Description: Add this component on the fracture template. When the piece is woken
    up, it will try to detect collision / overlap with a collider with a specific
    tag. If found, the rigid body will be set to kinematic, thus appearing frozen
    in place. Great for having glass fragments stick to a frame's edge.
