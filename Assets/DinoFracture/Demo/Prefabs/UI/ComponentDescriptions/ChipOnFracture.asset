  Description: 'Applying this to a fracturing object will cause fracture pieces outside
    the fracture position and specified radius to be "glued" together as a if it
    were a single object. This gives the impression that only a few pieces have been
    chipped off the original object.


    In order for this to function, the FractureGeometry
    script must have the FractureSize parameter set to something non-zero. Also,
    the Fracture() overload taking a Vector3 local position should be used (as is
    the case when using FractureOnCollision).'
